How did viewing two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

    It showed me exactly where I made the mistake. Without it I would be looking everywhere.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can save a lot of time searching for bugs.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

    Pros: I can choose when to commit whereas Google Docs for example creates one automatically for me so it makes the history difficult to understand.
    Cons: It might be laborious to create one manually.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because changes might have occured on all files in the commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can see the complete commit log using git log and can compare different commits using git diff.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

    I can move more ambitiously with a new technique or a solution and then revert back to see if I screwed up or if the code screwed up.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try to using Git for?

    Android Development
