What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need it?

    It makes a folder accessible by git and we need it to show previous versions of it using git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    I think that when a logical change to documents has been done, it can be stored in that single commit with other files that have been 
    changed as well. It doesn't commit only one file.

How can you use the staging area to make sure that you have one commit per logical change?

    If I forget what I just saved, I can check out what I just did before commiting it.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

    I can use branches to check out stuff I don't want to check out on the master branch. I can keep the master branch official
    and keep it's history relevant to it's current purpose.
