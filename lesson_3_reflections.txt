When would you want to create a new repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote
repository?

    You don't want to commit every change made in the remote repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    I would use forks when I want to clone a repo on github itself instead of copying it on my machine. I could use clone to
    get it to my machine to edit it. I could use branches to test new features and such.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored loclly?

    I would know how my local state differs from the remote state. I would know what to do if a merge conflict rises.

How would you collaborate without using Git or Github? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    It would be a lot easier with git and github to manage the development of a projects and it's versions at any given time.
    Without git or github, I don't see a way I could go as fast as I would had I been using them. Maybe pull requests can be
    handled better?
